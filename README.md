# Python Web Frameworks Comparison
Helping you select a Python web framework based on an example 
contacts written many times with various frameworks and ORMs.

I live stream building the apps on 
[Livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/mattmakai).


## What's the web app?
We're building a contacts manager that can call selected numbers and put 
everyone into a conference call.


## App Statuses

| Web Framework | Templating Engine | Form Handling |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Flask         | Jinja2            | WTForms       |



Current statuses.

* `flask_sqlalchemy`: done, but probably needs code clean up
* `bottle_sqlalchemy`: done, also needs code clean up
* `morepath_sqlalchemy`: initial commit, not yet working
* `django_default_orm`: not yet started, after morepath version
