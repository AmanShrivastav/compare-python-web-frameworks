# Python Web Frameworks Comparison
Helping you select a Python web framework based on an example 
contacts written many times with various frameworks and ORMs.

I live stream building the apps on 
[Livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/mattmakai).


## What's the web app?
We're building a contacts manager that can call selected numbers and put 
everyone into a conference call.


## App Statuses
Current statuses.

* `flask_sqlalchemy`: done, but probably needs code clean up
* `bottle_sqlalchemy`: almost done, needs form handling to add contacts
* `morepath_sqlalchemy`: not yet started, next on list
* `django_default_orm`: not yet started, after morepath
